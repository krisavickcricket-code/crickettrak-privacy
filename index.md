*Last updated: February 20, 2026*

## Overview

CricketTrak.ai ("the App") is a professional video recording application for Android. This privacy policy explains how the App handles your data.

## Data Collection

**CricketTrak.ai does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.** All video, audio, and settings data remains entirely on your device.

## Device Permissions

The App requests the following permissions to function. All data accessed through these permissions stays on your device unless you explicitly choose to share it.

### Camera
Used to capture video from your device's built-in camera or a connected USB/UVC camera. Camera data is recorded to local storage only.

### Microphone
Used to record audio alongside video. Audio is encoded and saved locally on your device.

### Storage (Photos, Videos, Files)
Used to save recorded videos to your device and to load videos for editing, enhancement, and stitching within the App's tools.

### Internet & Network State
Used solely for optional live streaming features (YouTube, Twitch, Facebook). No data is sent to any server unless you explicitly initiate a live stream. Network state is checked to determine connectivity for streaming.

### Bluetooth
Used to connect to external Bluetooth audio devices (microphones) for recording.

### Wi-Fi State
Used for optional Wi-Fi camera connectivity features.

### Notifications
Used to display recording status and progress notifications (e.g., during background recording or video processing).

### Foreground Service
Used to keep recording and video processing running reliably when the screen is off or the App is in the background.

### Battery Optimization Exemption
Requested to prevent the system from interrupting long-duration recordings.

## Third-Party Services

### Live Streaming (Optional)
If you choose to use live streaming, the App connects to third-party platforms (YouTube, Twitch, Facebook) using their official APIs. You authenticate directly with these platforms via OAuth. The App does not store your passwords. Authentication tokens are stored securely on your device using Android's EncryptedSharedPreferences.

Your use of these streaming platforms is subject to their respective privacy policies:
- YouTube / Google: https://policies.google.com/privacy
- Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/privacy-notice/
- Facebook / Meta: https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/

### Analytics & Crash Reporting
The App does not include any analytics, crash reporting, or tracking SDKs.

## Data Storage

All recorded videos, photos, settings, and preferences are stored locally on your device. The App does not use cloud storage or remote databases.

## Data Sharing

The App does not share your data with any third parties. You control when and how to share your recorded content through your device's standard sharing features.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect any data from children under 13. The App does not collect data from any user.
